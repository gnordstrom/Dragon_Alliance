            "description": "One word is often used to describe freesurfer Rob Machado: Style. While the Aussie-born, California-bred surfer has won many of surfing’s most prestigious contests, he’s always preferred surfing on his own terms. With long hair and a laid-back style both in and out of the water, Machado’s effortless approach to waves has been emulated by kids and adults all over the world. Currently he's building uniquely shaped boards and surfing in exotic destinations for movies and fun, he also gives to the next generation of surfers and supports sustainability efforts through his Rob Machado Foundation.",

An accomplished surfer who didn’t get his first sponsor until the age of 26 when many surfers are already three-fourths through with their careers, Reef has only improved with age. He’s been one of the 28 invitees to the Eddie since 2009, won the Best Barrel category at the Surfer Poll awards in 2012, and is known to always have a giant smile on his face.",

An eleven-year world tour competitor, Shane left the tour in 2003 to focus on big waves and soon after helped pilot some of the safety vests for big wave surfing. A favorite among other surfers, the soft-spoken 2016 Big Wave of the Year Winner still competes in the occasional contest but prefers to hunt waves (and food) on his own time in more wild destinations around the world.",

Ace Buchan began surfing at age four and was a two-timeAustralian Pro Junior Champion before graduating to the World Championship Tour where his backside attack and incredible tube riding ability won him multiple events in Tahiti and France. He’s humble by nature, but his community involvement and surfing have made him one of the most likeable surfers around. Besides being the author of the children’s book “Macka’s Barrel into the Dreamtime,” Ace also works with various non-profit organizations including the Inspire Foundation and Reach Out, which helps kids going through difficult times. He’s currently ranked top ten on the WSL tour, with great things to come in and out of the water.",
